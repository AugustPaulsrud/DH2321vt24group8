                        Design:

                            <li>Learned how to use D3.js and Plotly.js to create visual mappings for effective visualisations.</li>
                            <li>Learned how to combine D3.js and Plotly.js with React.js in order to facilitate data and view transformations.</li>
                            <li>Learned how to facilitate actionable insights through our visualizations by using the visualization pipeline and methods learned in the course.</li>
                            <li>Practiced how to discuss the design and the visualization choices within the team and with the intended user on how to balance the user needs with time constraints.</li>
                            <li>Practiced concurrent collaboration on GitHub and how to collaborate on different features using Agile methodologies.</li>

                        Defend:

                            <li>Although the prerequisite domain knowledge needed to generate insights from the visualization tool was high (since it is a brain surgery procedure and used motion capture, things that we all were unfamiliar with), we were able to defend our design choices by continuously having meetings with the intended user and by reading articles related to the topic.</li>

                        Critique:

                            <li>We were able to criticize other visualization tools through domain theory. For example the default motion capture visualization tool that lacked interactive data transformations and did not facilitate much insight.</li>
                            <li>Learned how to critique our own visualizations through theories and practices learnt in the course. For example lack of direct manipulation.</li>

                            <li>Prepared, ran and analyzed a semi-structured interview with an external partner in order to  get criticism.</li>

                            <li>Demonstrated our visualization systems to our intended users / domain experts (Alessandro, Mario and Henrik)</li>
